  beautiful twin boys Freddie and Louie, and other children suffering
  from the rare, degenerative condition, CLN5 Batten disease. Freddie and Louie Dawkins are the only known twins in the world with
  this rare form of a rare disease. Born perfectly healthy in 2005, they
  became autistic, blind and recently developed epilepsy. When they were
  diagnosed in 2009, doctors said that without major advancements in
  medical science, there was no hope, no treatment and no cure. In February 2014 Andrew and Sarah decided to fight back through
  ‘Battle Batten’ their very own campaign to exclusively raise money for
  research into CLN5 Batten disease. Originally aiming for just £1,000, they have so far raised an
  incredible £80,000 and unbelievably commissioned two research
  projects. They are the first UK family to privately commission
  research into CLN5 Batten disease; donating funds to the Batten
  Disease Family Association (BDFA), a charity who is managing the
  projects on the family’s behalf. The cash raised in just 12 months has been unexpected, and
  emotionally overwhelming for the family and still, the momentum and
  passion is strong. The family will continue to fundraise for as long

"43,970",Rebeccas Breast Cancer Healing Journey-Please Help,U.S. Dollar,,of $53k goal,293,"On April 9th of 2018 my wife, best friend, and mother of our 3
    boys, Rebecca Nowak was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma ER+
    and HER2+ an aggressive form of Breast Cancer .  When we
  received the news our worlds were flipped upside down to say the
  least.  I rushed home from work to put my arms around my wife and
  process this new reality, and within an hour received a call from the
  oncologist to come in and begin a plan of action on how we would treat
  the Cancer.  Those of you that know Rebecca know that we truly believe
  in Alternative and Natural ways of Healing, so we were caught in a
  circumstance that we needed more time to process.  We began praying
  and asking God for guidance on this Journey, and to align us with the
  right people/places, and the wisdom to make whatever decision He
  wanted us to make to get Rebecca well.  After much prayer, Receiving
  ""Signs"" and doing tons of research regarding Natural
  Treatments for Cancer we decided to send my wife to an Alternative
  Cancer Center in Tijuana Mexico. (To Read The Full Story of What Led
  us to Mexico Scroll to the bottom section of this page) Since the Diagnosis, and the First trip to Mexico, we discovered that
  the Cancer has Tripled in size, Metastasized to her Lymph nodes and
  possibly her liver.  We are at a point where we need to combat this
  cancer full force but are running out of funds to do so.  Meanwhile,
  The Cancer continues to takes it's toll on Rebecca's body.  This
  morning at 4am I woke up to find my wife sobbing by my side and
  telling me that she's scared and that her whole body hurts, especially
  her liver and back.  The Cancer is growing at a pace greater than the
  treatment that we have been able to give her up to now.  We need to
  get Rebecca to Mexico for an extended stay of 3-4 weeks where she will
  be monitored constantly and given the most aggressive treatments
  possible to counteract what the Cancer is currently doing.  Some of
  the treatments will include Vitamin C, Ozone, Letrile and IUV
  therapies along with a Natural Cancer Killing Tonic, Natural Form of
  ""Chemo"" (Kills the Cancer Cells without Killing the Good
  Cells), and an Estrogen Receptor Blocker because the Cancer is
  Estrogen Fed.   The cost of Rebecca's Treatment, Testing, Scans, for
  3-4 weeks  will cost $53,000. To all of our family and friends that have taken time to read
    this, Thank you.  Please share with your family, church family and
    friends as well.  We will need your help to reach this goal. -Justin Nowak The Full Story on What led us to Mexico In November 2017 Rebecca had a Thermogram done to check for Breast
  Cancer due to a suspicious lump in her breast.  She was given a clean
  bill of health and told by the Thermographer that it was nothing to be
  concerned with and not Cancer.  We were relieved at that point and
  went on with our lives but the lump continued to increase in size. 
  Five Months Later on April 3rd we scheduled a Biopsy which confirmed
  that it was in fact Grade 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma ER+ and HER2+. 
  The news was devastating and we began to pray for signs and direction
  from God on what to do next.  After weeks of doing it on our own with
  a strict diet change, supplements, and cleansing the lymphatic system,
  with no real improvement, we realized that we needed to get my wife in
  the care of specialists.   Rebecca decided to call the Thermographer
  to let her know that she misdiagnosed us, she apologized and explained
  that most scan and tests are never 100% accurate and they always
  recommend a second opinion if we have concerns.  She also told Rebecca
  that she understood what she was going through because 30 years ago
  she was diagnosed with breast cancer and she beat it naturally at an
  Alternative Treatment Center in Tijuana, Mexico.  Then she proceeded
  to tell Rebecca that she had sent over 500 patients to this clinic in
  the past 15 years and they have all been healed naturally of Cancer. The following morning I was looking through unpacked boxes (We had
  just finished a move to Idaho from California when she was diagnosed)
  trying to find a power cord for the printer to print up some
  documents, with no luck.  On the 20th or so box that I cut open, I
  found a white bag with a bright yellow business card in it.  The color
  of the card caught my attention so I picked it up.  The business card
  was for the same clinic in Mexico and on the back of the card, it read
  Ogden, IA. I was in awe, so I asked my wife where
  she got this card from?  She was blown away to and had forgotten all
  about the card.  She proceeded to tell me that an older gentleman that
  used to come into her work in Iowa gave it to her and said, ""If you, or anyone that you know ever gets cancer, you
    should go to this place, they saved my life and they can save
  yours"" .  Rebecca had this card for 12 years.  It made it
  from Iowa, to 4 different homes in California and now to Idaho to be
  found within hours of hearing about this clinic for the first time
  ever from the Thermographer. Four days later, I was at a swap meet in Garden City, ID.  Within a
  few minutes of being there, I see a guy wearing a Classic Ford Bronco
  Shirt which catches my attention because I sell Classic Ford Bronco
  parts for a living and I own a Classic Ford Bronco, so I say,
  ""Hey man, I like your shirt"" After talking Trucks with him
  for a few minutes, we find out that I have sold him parts in the past
  and he knew who I was. I explained the situation to him about my wife
  and he proceeds to tell me about his mother passed from Breast
  Cancer.  When I told him that we were sending my wife to an
  Alternative Treatment Center in Mexico, his face lit up and he
  proceeds to tell me that his friends wife was battling Cancer for
  years and had been given 3 weeks to live by her
  Dr’s. They wanted to give her one more round of
  Chemo in hopes that it would help, but she refused.  With nothing else
  to lose, she decided to go to a treatment center in Mexico which ended
  up being the same Clinic that my wife and I are going to, and is alive
  and well today",https://fundrazr.com/e1Nbl6

"631,762",British Gut,,,,,"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The American Gut Project (AGP) / The Microsetta Initiative to expand the study of the bacterial diversity to
    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, it will then be sent to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and analyzed. We estimate that the whole process will take about 4-5 months . Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different).   In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,
      and we do not provide any personalized interpretation . It will take longer than the expected 4-5 months to receive
      results if you are submitting one of the following sample types: Oral, skin, animal, and environmental samples . A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our

"5,000",Please Help Olesia Walk Again,Russian Ruble,,of ₽700k goal,2,"Hi there! My name is Olesia, and I extremely need your help. I know
  there are too many stories like this on the internet these days, so,
  all I hope for is that you read this to the end, and then decide
  whether you want to support my cause. Any tiny bit of your help
  counts, including advice. In 2015, I had to undergo four spinal surgeries in a row. However, I
  never recovered, and even developed additional troubles. Since then, I
  can hardly walk with a walking aid. During these past three years,
  I've been basically left alone to deal with my problems, but not only
  did my efforts to get back on my feet prove useless, my condition has
  actually even aggravated, and slowly keeps doing so. These days, I
  barely leave my apartment. Basically, I cannot leave it without
  someone's assistance. What makes it even harder, I can neither sit not
  stand for long because of strong back pain and increasing numbness in
  my legs. In my country, the doctors are rather skeptical about my condition,
  which is awfully discouraging. However, I started searching for
  opportunities abroad, and found this one surgeon willing to try and
  help with my case: http://www.dr-bertagnoli.com He believes that, most likely, another surgery is needed to solve at
  least part of my problems. But so far, it is only a question of
  thourough examination to establish the treatment strategy. Anyway, he
  sees chances of improvement, and after hearing 'no way' for so many
  times, it is really like a breath of fresh air. However, here I stumble upon another predictable problem: money. The pre-surgery examination will cost EUR 10,000 to 13,000. The surgery, if all is fine and it follows, is roughly estimated
  at EUR 130,000. These are amounts I cannot possibly afford. And then again, I
  don't even know yet how much I'll have to spend on my recovery
  afterwards, nor how long it will take. I have to admit that money was never my life priority. I probably
  never had much, but I used to think I had enough. Now things prove me wrong. I have been trying to collect the necessary amount with the help
  of friends, acquaintances, friends of friends, etc. But it is still
  not enough. Also, I have to deal with my running expenses, which has
  become tricky, too. Being currently unable to work, and with a monthly
  disability allowance of less than USD 130, I have already come to the
  point where I barely cover my basic medical bills. I keep looking for and trying every opportunity I come across. I keep
  searching for other, better, and hopefully more affordable, options.
  But there are none so far. I desperately want to walk again. I know that, even with all the
  empathy, you can't quite understand the feeling. I hope you can't. The
  only way for such understanding is to go through similar kind of
  experience, and it's really something I wish no one ever had to do. It's not just the physical pain. I am the kind of person who
  likes to spend a lot of time on foot, who manages to do everything
  while walking – reading, studying and working included. Or rather, I
  used to be this kind of person. In a stressful situation, or just to
  sort some thoughts out, I would always go for a walk, and I could
  spend hours like this. Now, I am deprived of this opportunity, as well
  as of many other things I appreciated so much in my life. I also feel
  very old, since I invest most of my time in treating my deseases and
  talking about them. Every day I wake up broken, and every day I
  have to get myself together again. I don't want to be like this. Nor do I want to be a burden on my
  parents' shoulders. Honestly, I could never have thought that, at my
  age, they will have to take care of me, not vice versa. I strongly believe that in the modern world, where they manage to
  help fully paralyzed people, there must be a possibility for me to
  recover, if not fully, then to a certain extent. I just should somehow
  get access to this possibility. I just have to use every chance to
  improve my condition, no matter how unattainable it seems. But, in any
  case, I can't do it on my own. Not anymore. I have already exhausted
  all my resources. All I can do now is count on support from others and
  hope it will all somehow work out. I hope that you take part in this and give me a chance. Thank
  you in advance for your help! I do appreciate it greatly.",https://fundrazr.com/pleasehelpolesia

  my antique tractor and riding snowmobiles, sailing, and riding my
  motorcycles.  I've always had sleep issues and had fought against an
  irregular sleep pattern which eventually became too much and my sleep
  pattern started to free-run on a 26 hour circadian rhythm. The
  hypernychthemeral disorder was in addition to a long history of light
  sensitivity and I had struggled with both from puberty on. This winter I was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and two
  months ago, I was given a CPAP machine to help me keep breathing
  during sleep. Recently, we lost our insurance which means that I will
  be losing my CPAP machine that was thirty days from being paid for by
  insurance and my risks of both heart attack and stroke will
  essentially triple. I hate asking for help but have no other option as we cannot
  afford health insurance that will cover the CPAP and still allow us
  luxuries like food and heat, let alone internet access. I was forced to return the machine on Tuesday the 18th but I had
  already planned ahead for that. The goal is the same, to replace the
  CPAP I no longer have with one of two choices, they are equivalent
  machines and provide exactly the same support I need and that my
  prescription calls for (these are prescribed devices, I should not be
  able to buy one at Amazon or Ebay at all by law). I will be posting
  links to the two options below. My preference is actually for the
  lower priced one but I had based this campaign on the other one since
  that's specifically what was ordered on my prescription that also
  states that substitutions are allowed. I would appreciate any help at all, my wife, son, and I are

"16,660",URGENTLY NEEDED New Hips for Christian McCudden!!,Australian Dollar,"Nov 21, 2018",of $81k goal,29,"Hi, my wife and I have been friends with Christian and Melissa for nearly
    twenty years... it has been many years since we have caught up with
    this wonderful family and after a recent phone conversation with
    Christian we have only just now learned of the ongoing physical
    hardship he has been going through over the years and the very
    difficult decision he has just had to make..... After our chat I thought there has to be something we can do to
    help, so I have setup this campaign in the hope that you will all
    join us in standing together to make a massive difference to
    Christian’s upcoming journey! Following is a snapshot of the McCudden family and Christian’s
    journey so far and the reasons why our donations are so very vital
    and impactful at this time for them... Christian has been married to Melissa for 21 yrs. and they have
    3 three amazing children, Noah, Ella and Zachary. In 2013 Christian & Melissa moved from their home in
    Sydney's northern beaches leaving family, friends and working at C3
    Oxford falls as one of the full time pastors, and planted C3 church
    Noosa, launching in May of 2013. Prior to planting C3 Noosa they were a part of C3 Oxford falls
    for 20 years. Over that time Christian fulfilled many roles in various
  areas including: Youth ministry for 12yrs / Pastoring / Lecturing in the Bible College. Travelled with and assisted Ps Phil for 6 years. Project managed the buildings and renovations that went on over the
  years at C3 Oxford falls. Christian has also over many years ministered in Church's throughout
  Australia, New Zealand, America, Europe, Asia and Indonesia seeing
  many people saved, healed and touched by the power of God. He has also seen over the year’s incredible healings and testimonies. Blind eyes opened / Deaf ears opened / Cancer healed Crippled people getting out of wheel chairs / Stroke patients healed
  and walking and speaking. Pain leaving bodies immediately / Blood conditions healed / People
  who were suicidal set free Dead raised to life / Arthritis conditions healed Broken bones healed instantly… and many more stories to be told. Christian and Melissa have now been on the Sunshine Coast QLD for 5
  1/2 years with C3 Noosa just celebrating its 5th birthday.  A church
  that is vibrant, growing, and impacting many lives in their local
  community and beyond. As this all still continues to grow and function
  Christian currently works part time for their church C3 Noosa and full
  time as a carpenter, building on job sites. Over the past 8 years Christian has
    suffered with pain in his body from a gradual degenerative arthritic
    condition in both his hips. In the past 4 years the pain has become
    very intense with major side effects such as only being able to
    sleep a couple of sound hours a night, having limited movement,
    unable to exercise or do the physical things he loves to do and
    especially with his kids. Two years ago Christian had the
    opportunity to go over to the U.S to get stem cell treatment in both
    hips which has helped to a small degree but has not been able to see
    the full benefits due to his current working activity of being on
    the tools building. Building over the last few years
      has taken a huge toll on his body and made the pain more intense.
      Christian has now come to a place where he cannot physically
      continue to do his work labouring as a builder, due to the extreme
      pain and limited movement. He has no other option left other than to proceed with
      further treatment being a double hip replacement! A double hip replacement and the extensive rehabilitation
        involved is quite costly and the road to full recovery is a good
        6 to12 months! In a matter of days Christian will have no income from building as he has had to give notice and quit due to his bodies inability
    to function sufficiently in the way needed to perform his role as a
    builder and his bodies pain levels have reached a crippling level. Christian needs our help NOW! The results from this will be amazing! It will give Christian back his quality of life! It will give
      him back the things that we take for granted like having a full
      night’s sleep, having no crippling pain, being able to exercise,
      and the ability to do normal life activities with his children
      while they are still young! We would love to enable Christian to get this surgery done ASAP
      and for him to have the appropriate time required for a full recovery. It is a costly procedure and the post-operative rehabilitation
      expenses required will be quite high. To enable Christian to have the procedure and the necessary
        time off not needing to labour physically in the building
        industry is a minimum of six months..... So that’s what we have
        based the amount of funds needed to raise on: - The double hip
        replacement surgery, rehabilitation and physical therapy for six
        months and funds to keep the family afloat while Christian is
        unable to work. So we kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless
        Christian and his family at this time as they make plans towards
        treatment, surgery and rehabilitation. Christian has been such a faithful servant and blessing to so
      many lives over the years. A servant’s heart through and through
      and one of the most generous people you will ever meet. If you are reading this then you have probably been blessed in
        some form either directly or indirectly from the big hearted
        kindness of this faithful man. We now we get the opportunity to sow back into this rich soil of
    an amazing family and help them in their time of need! They are so humble and never complain most people wouldn’t even
      know about this ongoing struggle over the years and how Christian
      has been enduring such pain in his body while going about blessing others! Let’s all band together to quickly raise the funds for this
        much needed surgery! If we all dig deep, give what we can and pass this on to our
        various friends and networks then Christian will be on the road
        to recovery before we know it... Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations.... God Bless!!",https://fundrazr.com/f1MWCb
820,Leg amputation avoided! Very slow-healing recovery,U.S. Dollar,,of $14.8k goal,22,"We need urgent help - can you reach out to us? My name is Maria del
  Rocio Garcia, and I have setup this Fundrazer page for my S/O
  (Significant Other/Fiance) Thomas Ernst.  (He is German so there is a
  summary in his language below this English text) He was
  hospitalized with a aggressive tissue decaying infection in his left
  leg below the knee December 2016 with the initial diagnoses by several
  doctors to amputate the leg above the knee. Dr. Mar Chavira at
  Salvatierra hospital in La Paz did not share that opinion and
  initiated treatment and procedures to rescue the limb and avoid an
  pending amputation. The goal of this fundraising..if met...would
  cover our medical expenses incurred so far (+/-9,500,-US $) as well
  the cost of living / debt accumulated during the time of the illness
  and recovery without any income and would supply the funding required
  to find another rental moving to a better location with option to work
  for him (+/- 5500,-US $) Please read explanation in details further
  down and in the blog we have started. Basically we are not capable on our own power to leave the
  sub-average lifestyle zone we are in right now and funding would
  provide a huge help to Thomas Ernst and me assisting to restart our
  life to a ""normal"", simple lifestyle level again. This
  is basically ""our story"" in a nutshell. Please read in
  detail below and may consider making a donation to allow T.E. to get
  back to work, to manage the significant debt accumulated from his
  battle with the infection. A donation of any kind will be greatly
  appreciated and would be a huge help. Also, please feel free to
  forward on the link to anyone you think might be interested in
  supporting the cause. Please use this contact form If you have
  any questions. Otherwise, thank you for your time and consideration of
  this effort to help Thomas Ernst and
  me. --------------------------------------------------- We
  do not have a professional background to create such fundraiser pages
  as this here in the proper way and writing. My English also has
  severe flaws and I apologize for that. It is work in progress as
  we been forced to change the fundraiser platform due to the
  circumstances that prior used crowdfund Youcaring merged with GoFundMe
  and by their policy is Mexico a Non-GoFundMe supported Country
    and they will shut down. You find info on this here You can see screenshots of received donations during the past 2
  weeks here on our blog . The prior campaign did not generate any support since put online June
  2017 until Maria and a local good Samaritan, Francisco Lopez, reached
  out at the Baja Nomads forum and made the
  situation known at the beginning of May 2018. Them folks made already
  a HUGE impact on our life. Having everyday ""real"" food
  (prior eating for weeks beans & rice or Marushan), all medical
  supplies required and having made some payments to most pressing debt
  collectors, have electricity and communication secured. All this is
  already a big relieve creating some breathing space. Also here
  you find the progress in several sets of images from December 2016 on
  until August 2017 when we had to see phone with camera used. Please be
  aware - some of this images are VERY graphical and not for everybody's
  stomach to view!!! Album - Gallery until August 2017 here on Google documents . We have genuinely tried during the past 18 month to progress yet the
  combination of advancing the healing with ambulant treatment (the
  first 6 month 2-3x per week hospital visits), the cost of medication,
  medical supplies and transportation, basic cost of living - rent,
  electricity, telefon, food was in dimensions to large to cope for us.
  Ernst Thomas has no family or relatives, Maria has a small income from
  a clerical position in a hotel working night-shifts. We have sold any valuables to create funds, we have no vehicle. Ernst
  Thomas was still recovering from the impact hurricane Norbert and
  Odile created 2014. ###################################################################### German Summary - E.T. ist jederzeit bereit mit Ihnen in Deutsch zu kommunizieren und evtl. Fragen zur

  cancer journey that started way back in 2005. She
  hoped that new posts wouldn't be necessary.  But unfortunately, she
  received some bad news.  Breast cancer.  Again.  For the third time.
   I'll borrow the title from one of her early posts... ""Ain't That Some Shit!"" If you're reading this, you know Treva's personality and can hear her
  voice and brutal honest truth in those words.  You also know her
  strength - her ability to fight endlessly and to also be there for
  every single person when they need her. The financial burden of cancer is beyond tremendous.  It's hard
  enough to go through treatment and all that comes with it.  We want
  for Treva, Marshall and Bella to not feel the strain of medical bills.
   We want for their lives to continue as normally as possible during
  this time.  Would you help make this possible? Hundreds and hundreds of people love Treva and her beautiful

"8,215",Hannah's Heroes,U.S. Dollar,,of $177k goal,195,"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah",https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes
"3,345",Top Surgery Support Fund for Nate,Canadian Dollar,,of $3k goal,44,"Hi! My name is Katie and I am creating this fundraiser to support our
  friend and community member, Nate. As some of you may know, our dear friend Nate is having top surgery
  on September 13, 2018. Top surgery is a gender-affirming procedure
  that many trans folks like Nate undergo in order to live life in a
  more comfortable, accessible way.  Nate has been on waiting lists for
  this surgery for over 5 years and he has been binding for 12 years for
  anywhere from 12 - 16 hours per day. This daily binding has taken a
  toll on his body and this surgery will greatly improve Nate's quality
  of life and the ease with which he moves through the world. As a
  community, we have an opportunity to come together to support Nate
  during this exciting and challenging time by helping him to pay for
  surgery and supporting him during his recovery time. HOW WILL THE MONEY BE USED? 1) While OHIP covers much of the cost of this surgery, there is a
  cost of $2,360 that is not covered by OHIP. We hope to raise at least
  this much money so that Nate can focus on recovery and does not have
  the burden of this surgery cost weighing on him. 2) It would be absolutely wonderful if we could raise some money to
  support Nate's costs of living and healing process while he is off
  work after his surgery. As most of Nate's friends and community know,
  he works as a baker (and is darn amazing at it!). While baking is one
  of Nate's great passions, it is also a very physically demanding job
  and will require Nate to be off of work for 8 - 12 weeks-- much longer
  than if he had a less physical job. Any money raised over and above
  the initial goal of $2,360 will go directly to supporting Nate's
  recovery. No amount is too little to donate, even if it is only a few dollars! WHAT IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO DONATE? It's totally okay if you aren't able to donate right now! Here are
  some other ways you can help Nate: 1) SHARE THIS FUNDRAISER! Let's get the word out there by sharing
  this fundraiser on social media - give your friends and community the
  opportunity to help out by sharing this campaign. 2) Consider creative ways that you could contribute. For example,
  maybe you don't have the cash, but maybe you work somewhere that would
  be cool with you putting out a donation jar! 3) Offer tangible support. You can reach out to Nate's partner Tanya
  at smithsalter -at- gmail -dot- com to arrange tangible support. For
  example: running errands, dropping off food, dog walking, garden help,
  etc. while Nate recovers. 3) Support The Feral Knot on Etsy and beyond! Nate's partner, Tanya, has a
  (super amazing) small business creating macrame art, rustic woodwork,
  healing plants, and facilitating macrame workshops. You can support
  The Feral Knot by liking the page on Facebook / Instagram , sharing, and as the holidays approach,
  consider supporting Nate and Tanya by supporting The Feral Knot. 4) Reach out to Nate for social get-togethers beginning 1- 2 weeks
  after surgery! Nate will be recovering for 8 - 12 weeks, and after the
  initial post-surgery period, he will appreciate friends reaching out
  for low-key coffee, picnics, and hang outs. Anyone who knows and has shared space with Nate knows that he is an
  incredible, generous, and caring human being. Nate deserves all of the
  support in the world, and I am confident that we can help to ease some
  of the financial burden that comes with surgery and post-surgery healing. WANT TO LEARN MORE? Feeling confused about top surgery, recovery times, and all of this
  other stuff? Here are some great resources about top surgery and what
  is needed for healing: https://www.healthline.com/health/transgender/top-surgery#recovery",https://fundrazr.com/natestopsurgery
"6,705",Please help Matthew!,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,23,"Matthew and his sister Tiffani were born with what is called CVID,
  common variable immunodeficiency.  Both were being treated under a
  Professor,with the medication called Octagam once a month through an
  IV drip.Matthew had an unfortunate experience in the last month, where
  he had a reaction to the Octagam and caused him to end up in hospital
  having lumbar punctures, MRI scans and sonars.  Unfortunately he is
  now unable to receive the Octagam as its a gamble as to whether or not
  he would have the same issues happen again. The option now is to move
  to the subcutaneous medication which is extremely costly. The medical
  aid will cover a portion of this every month, but I am short R5000 per
  month on a 4 week month and R10000 on a 5 week month.  There is also
  the cost of a pump to purchase of over R8000 which medical aid does
  not cover. If I cannot raise enough money, Matthew will not receive
  the correct amount of medication each month, which could lead to more
  infections.  Matthew and I are requesting any form of support no
  matter how big or small that you can give us to help him lead a normal
  healthy life. Thanks to all the local and international kind hearted
  people matt could start his therapy on his correct level for this
  month. It’s been a very trying time for the past two days but my
  little boy has managed to be so brave. I can only thank the support we
  have received, please don’t stop with the support",https://fundrazr.com/11Ko66
660,Help little Bernardo,Pound Sterling,,of £800 goal,27,"For those of you who don't know me, I'm David, a primary school
  teacher in London, just having returned from a summer holiday to
  Brazil. During one of our many visits to the beach in Rio De Janeiro,
  Rafael, my 6 year old son made friends with a little Brazilian girl
  called Laura, and since then we've got to know her family. So over the
  last five or six weeks I've been learning about the sad story of
  Laura's little brother, Bernardo who is 2. He is currently in hospital
  as a result of a condition called hydrocephalus. This basically means
  he has an accumulation of spinal fluid on the brain which is causing a
  very real threat to his health. Since I met his family, he's been in
  and out of intensive care and has been in hospital for weeks now.
  Fortunately his mum was able to just about scrape together enough to
  pay for an operation a short while ago to remove the build up of
  fluid. Before that Bernardo was at risk of cardiac arrest. However for
  now, Bernardo is still stuck in the hospital because he hasn't yet had
  a more permanent solution: a valve installed to remove the excess
  spinal fluid on his brain as it continues to build up. Fortunately, his mum has a basic healthcare insurance plan through
  her bank. This has basically saved Bernardo's life over the last few
  weeks. Unfortunately, although the health insurance she has is enough
  to pay for his stay in the hospital, it does not extend to the surgery
  that he needs to keep him safe. For those who haven't been to Brazil, it is very much the haves and
  the have nots and the have nots don't have even the healthcare they
  need to, in some cases, survive. They of course have no NHS. Since
  I've known Bernardo's mum, she has lost her home, evicted because of
  paying all her money to the hospital for the last operation to keep
  Bernardo alive.  Currently her and little Laura are being housed by a
  friend, and they can't leave Rio and go back to their family because
  Bernardo is stuck in the hospital there in Rio. If Bernardo is able to have the valve operation, he will be healthy
  enough to be discharged from hospital without fear of going back into
  intensive care because of another build up of spinal fluid on the
  brain. As it stands, the hospital are itching to discharge him because
  of the flimsy health insurance plan that his family hsve, so it's a
  matter of urgency that he gets this operation quickly to keep him safe. Below, I've copied and pasted (via Google translate in Portuguese) an
  appeal from him mum, who has obviously been through a lot in the
  recent past. WHAT'S THE PRICE OF A LIFE FOR YOU? In 2016 Bernardo was born with 38 centimeters and 2.5 kg. Inside
    my belly Bernardo, was diagnosed with a disease called obstructive
    hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is the excessive accumulation of
    cerebrospinal fluid inside the skull, which leads to cerebral
    swelling. This type of disease occurs when there is a blockage in
    the ventricular system of the brain, preventing the cerebrospinal
    fluid from flowing normally through the brain and spinal cord. And
    through this Bernardo was born with great cerebral swelling, today
    he needs to undergo a new surgery for a valve so that the
    cerebrospinal fluid can travel through the brain normally, so he can
    survive and try to live a normal life. Today Bernardo does not walk
    and does not speak, Due to his deficiency. Today Bernardo is
    hospitalized, needing to undergo a new surgery so he can try to lead
    a normal life. In addition to this surgery, Bê needs medical
    follow-ups, remedies and physical therapy treatment. Today I and my
    family find ourselves very distressed because of poor health,
    undergoing several changes. And Bernardo trying to survive day after
    day. Being a fight for me, a single mother of two. But every day I
    look at that bed fighting to survive and where it renews my
    strength. My only hope is to see him walk and talk and to that. I'm
    struggling every day so this can be accomplished. Bê is a child full
    of will power to live and my biggest desire was to offer a better
    life for him, but I was surprised by a disease where I fight with
    him to win. We would like the help of you all  By donating what you can, you
    can save a life! OUR BERNARDO DESERVES TO LIVE! HELP HIM TO LIVE! WE CONTINUE WITH
    HIS HELP. I don't usually do these types of things, but this story in
  particular touched me first because of my son making friends with them
  on the beach and secondly because it made me wonder what I would do if
  it was my son in that situation and I couldn't manage to get him the
  health care he needed just to live and be safe. So I really wanted to
  help and I thought crowdfunding and social media would be the best
  way. I just really wanted to do SOMETHING. So please, any small
  donation would help. As you can see, Bernardo's mum says that even
  post operation he will need to do physical therapy and other things afterwards. They have tried to do Crowdfunding out there in Brazil, but it hasn't
  worked so well. The pound goes a lot further out there than the
  Brazilian Real (R$), so I think that a many small donations from us
  over here could make a massive difference and take them to the target
  of the operation. Obviously I'd be very grateful, his family would be
  much more so and of course I would promise to keep you update on his progress.",https://fundrazr.com/HelplittleBernardo

    more new friends) Be occupied all the time- “There are always things to do”. Exercising (without need of gym equipment) Offering Chances to explore new things “A New Meaning in Life” Being said the above, is through experience which we tried, and seems
  to help a test patient condition to be better. By combining the setup of Aquaponics system and Deli Kitchen can help
  to provide mentally ill patients in such:- Providing income Helping them learning new skills Meeting up with different people Eating healthy Helping them utilizing their time properly Helping them to understand the better meaning of survival Reducing their mental stress We have been understand, researching and planning for nearly 8- 10
  years for this project, we feel that most of the time, humans need
  each other to cope with day to day life, and building a meaning in life. In this fast moving era, people struggling to cope with stress, and
  quite a number of them develop stress symptoms such as mental illness,
  which there is no medicine can help to cure, and most of the medicines
  provided by all clinics and hospitals do have serious side-effects,
  for example weigh gain and others unhealthy conditions for these
  mentally ill patients. Also society having a hard time to assist these mentally ill
  patients, therefore there is a need for us to have this project to
  help them. By understand what caused mental illness, we have develop this
  project to its maximum potential and sustainability. Every quarterly and yearly, the society organized a lot of fund
  raising to help these people, much money have been raised, but never
  enough to support the needs and care for these mentally and disability
  people. Therefore, we feel there is a need to have this project, and
  soon we will have this project all over the world to support these people. Therefore, we created “AQUADELI”. AquaDeli is create based on having a true 100% sustainable Aquaponic
  System, which capable of powering by itself and Deli Kitchen to
  showcase affordable good healthy food from our Aquaponic harvest. The KEY: Our Aquaponics System is capable to power the entire setup
    together with the deli kitchen electrical requirements. Does not need Solar Panels, Does not need Wind Turbine, Does not need Diesel Generators, Basically, we harness the energy from the moving water, and the
  chemical properties of water to create energy, as we know that
  electricity cost is very expensive. So we have develop a system with
  the help of our engineers to make full use of the environment “NATURE”
  around us to give us FREE Energy. Aquaponics is using Fishes, Prawns and Seeds: It is a simple Food chain process which make this whole
        project run. Meaning, plants from seeds needs nutrients and
        water to grow, by making use of “Fish poo (Manure)”, plants are
        able to grow better, naturally and chemical-free conditions. Why Prawns? Prawns are needed in this system, they act as the
        filter and composter for the Fish Poo, breaking down poo so that

    to ask for help but I'm in trouble. I have a heart condition called
    SVT. At times my heart can reach over 220 beats per minute. If left
    to long it can cause cardiac arrest or a stroke. I have been on meds
    for quite a while to control it but in the last year those meds have
    not been working as well. Back in March I was hospitalized and they
    performed an ablation to fix the problem. Unfortunately that did not
    work. I have lost employment because of not being able to be there
    on a daily basis. I have been to the ER numerous times in the last
    few months and as recent as yesterday. My Cardiologist has told me
    to only work part time at the moment. I did start a job last week
    but due to being in the ER yesterday and missing time I
    unfortunately can not go back. I have a second ablation scheduled for Dec 4th but not being
    able to work puts a strain not only on my mental state but my
    financial situation as well. I know times are tough for most people
    right now but I'm asking for assistance to get me through Nov and

"1,460",Help Nadia pay for gender affirming surgeries,Euro,,of €4k goal,39,"Hi there. My name is Nadia . I'm a neurodiverse
  transgender woman of color living The Netherlands. I was assigned male at birth, but for most of my life, especially
  since I started puberty I've been suffering from crippling dysphoria regarding my gender. Along with my ADHD , this led to me developing chronic
    depression, anxiety and agoraphobia in my late teens and
  young adulthood. Eventually I couldn't take it any more and realized
  that the only way I could ever be truly happy is to transition and start living as my most authentic self. I’ve lived in this body for 31 years, of which only the last 3 I've
  been on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) . This,
  along with things like permanent laser facial hair
  removal has gone a long way towards helping me look and feel
  like the woman I know I am. But there's only so much that hormones can
  do. It can't fix the parts of my body that cause me the most
  dysphoria. Only surgery can change those. When I first started transition, I didnt want to rush into any
  surgeries. After all, they're scary, permanent, invasive and very
  expensive. I was hoping HRT alone would be enough. But over the past 3
  years the pain I feel regarding these specific aspects of my body has
  been constant and persistent regardless of how much
  self love I try to practice. It’s not something that’s just
    going to go away on its own. Deciding on getting these procedures isn't a decision I made lightly.
  It came after years of deliberation and trying everything else I could
  think of to make this feeling go away. Over the past 9 months especially, my mental health has gone down the
  drain. A lot of the time I'm too scared to go outside by myself,
  because how transphobic society can be to someone like me. My loved
  ones, family members, and partners have noticed how much worse I've
  gotten. I've been feeling hopeless, gross and most of all stuck. Like
  I'm unable to move forward in any way. Just like my decision to come out and transition, the decision to get
  rid of my facial hair using laser hair removal, the decision to go on
  HRT, having these surgeries really is the best
  option. It’s the next step I need to take in my transition. Please consider donating if you’re able to. It would mean
      the world to me and you’d be helping me out in a big way. If
      you’re unable to donate please share the link as much as possible. Thank you. <3",https://fundrazr.com/helpnadia
"8,730",Please help Meredith get the spinal surgery she needs!,U.S. Dollar,"Nov 13, 2018",of $8k goal,74,"Hey friends and family. In March of this year while visiting Daniel’s
  parents in Panama we took a horseback ride (my first ever) on the
  beach where I rode a horse galloping across the sand for some time.
  (The photo above was taken on that trip before the horseback ride.)
  The next morning I had severe pain and difficulty walking. I saw a
  doctor there who suggested I continue with some chiropractic treatment
  when I got back to the states. Back in the US I continued to see
  several chiropractors, an acupuncturist, and a physical therapist.
  Some thought it was my piriformis muscle or my sacrum. But no matter
  the amount of rest or stretching the pain only got worse.  Eventually
  over the summer I received an MRI and consulted with an spine
    surgeon after finding out the issue was actually with my spine. I
    have a 4-5mm herniated disc on my L5 S1 that is pressing directly
    onto the nerve root in my left leg causing extreme pain and
    inflammation. Through this whole ordeal I have not had health insurance. Ive had to
  continue to work my personal assisting job which is fairly physical
  (cleaning, shopping, laundry, errands etc) to be able to pay cash for
  each treatment I received. I also started to drive for postmates and
  babysit to earn extra cash to pay for treatment. When that wasn’t
  enough Daniel, my family (hey mom hey dad) and even my boss have
  contributed financially to helping me heal my back. In August a dear
  friend (Holly) put me in touch with a reputable spine surgeon in
  Glendale, CA. He suggested I exhaust all options before considering
  surgery. So that is what I did. I continued aggressively with
  acupuncture, spinal decompression therapy, massage, hot and cold
  compresses, lots of rest, supplements, anti inflammatory diet, PT,
  oral steroids, CBD, you name it. I even tried meditation, reiki,
  hypnosis, and psychic surgery!!! The final and last option was an
  epidural steroid shot which I have had 2 of in the past two weeks and
  have not received any relief. At this point I need a minimally invasive surgery called a posterior
  lumbar microdiscectomy. Its a same day surgery but involves general
  anesthesia and about a 4 week recovery time. The surgery would remove
  the part of the disc that is compressing my nerve and spinal canal.
  Through prayer, some angelic energy in the universe and the kind
  referral of my friend Holly,  this surgeon has offered to completely
  waive his fee and perform my microdiscectomy costing me only the fees
  for the anesthesiologist and the medical facility! This will be about
  6-7,000 dollars. (I will also need some blood work and some X-rays
  done before the surgery is performed) This type of surgery isn’t covered under medi-cal or hmo insurance. 
  (Im not eligable for medi-cal and open enrollment for other insurance
  doesn’t begin coverage until Jan 2019)  Since about August I haven’t
  been able to drive for postmates to earn extra money because of the
  pain caused by sitting. The 8+ months of treatment have left me with
  no savings or financial padding at this point. I will also still need
  to pay my rent and feed myself during my 4 weeks of post op recovery. My closest friends have witnessed this journey but to others I have
  been fairly quiet about it all. As a performer it’s not a good look to
  hire someone who is suffering from a spinal injury. Also I kept having
  hope that one of the treatments one day would make an impact. My
  management even told me they would not submit me for anything until I
  was medically cleared by a doctor. (They have since dropped me during
  this process) To give you a peak into my world, normal daily
  activities are a major challenge for me. I have trouble putting my own
  pants and shoes on, shaving my legs, bending, sitting more than a few
  seconds or standing after sitting for a few minutes. I drive with a
  special decompression pillow in my car and I only wear special
  orthopedic sneakers. I can’t go do yoga or indoor cycling since March
  (something i used to do 3-4 times a week) or travel more than a few
  miles from home since sitting causes the most pain. I have to lay down
  several times during the day interrupting normal daily activities.
  This has been a real major life event and has given me much
  perspective on what’s most important in life. Our health and our loved
  ones.  I’m so appreciative to anyone who has reached out during this
  process or sent me a text. I’m especially grateful to Dr. Dave Rogers
  and Holly Hyman my real life fairy godsister. Anything you can
  contribute means the world and I thank you from the bottom of my
  heart. I know what it’s like to need every penny in your bank account,
  and I’m humbled by any contribution. Break down of finances : 1,000 for anesthesiologist fee 5,000 for medical facility fee 500 for X-rays, and blood work needed before operation 1,500 to cover my rent, food, and car insurance the month I will be
  recovering and won't be able to work.",https://fundrazr.com/71Pe66

"8,711",Road to Healing: Help Col with treatment and life!,U.S. Dollar,,of $42k goal,86,"A Message from Maria ... When I picture my friend Col, I envision light—a beautiful, warm,
  loving light. Her aura glows with this willingness to understand and empathize. That’s one of the reasons why this disease she has been battling is
  so difficult for me to come to grips with. It seems to be literally
  eating away at the insides of her physical body, and yet her mind and
  her spirit still keep glowing—still keep pushing on—despite the daily
  obstacles she faces. Col does not like to complain so she doesn't want us to list all of
  her symptoms, which are many. When you see her smiling and laughing
  with you, she's doing it amidst great pain and discomfort. Often it
  feels like she's dying. A number of her doctors don't take insurance and need to be paid out
  of pocket (just one office visit can cost $600!) and the treatment
  they prescribe is also not covered by insurance. She has been sick for
  numerous years so you can imagine the toll that that takes. Her illness is not something you'd know about unless you are close to
  her. But it's very serious and it severely impedes her quality of
  life. And her closest friends and family are very concerned— *We want her to be with us for years to come!* Please join me in doing what you can to help Col win this war within
  her body and pave her road to healing. A Message from Sue Elliott ... Have you ever met somebody — even online — and instantly loved that person? I’m not talking about lust. I’m not even talking about appreciation. What I mean is some sort of deep, soul-level recognition. A
  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved
  by so many! Sue Elliott Founder/Editor-in-Chief of Law of Attraction Magazine www.LovingMyself.com ..................................................

  several years ago and the fear that gripped me about my future at the
  time was overwhelming.I am so grateful to have found help in many ways
  to regain all of my health and feel younger and stronger than I have
  in over ten years. It was simply because I was lucky that I stumbled
  across the natural health solutions that led me out of my own private despair. So, my friend and fellow Social Entrepreneur with Evolv Health, Judy
  Adolf,  and I have been talking for some time about using the model of
  social giving to help individuals in our community who are overwhelmed
  with a health challenge. It is through no fault of their own they have
  been buried under financial strain which only compounds their health
  issues. We decided to help people with their health in general by
  creating a Wellness focussed community MEET UP GROUP called
  ""PURPOSEFUL WELLNESS which fulfills a mandate to inspire and
  educate others about nutrition, fitness and natural healing methods
  that can help. But we also added a unique component modelling our own
  Evolv Social Business and created a fundraising platform that could
  greatly impact someone suffering with an illness or disability. Many
  face these challenges quite unexpectedly and the financial strain is
  often beyond their ability to cope. So for the first 3 months of  ""Purposeful Wellness"" we
  decided to help our mutual friend Blu Mankuma who is a well loved
  actor/ entertainer in our community currently on Kidney dialysis who
  can no longer work at his profession. He is a kind and loving soul and
  we thought who better than Blu to be our first recipient in the
  charitable program we have implemented. Our goal is to raise at least 2,000. to contribute to his meagre
  income from pensions and disability. This would to take some of the
  strain off him so he can buy healthy food , pay his rent and perhaps
  regain some strength through an immune support product that he could
  otherwise never afford. Blu Mankuma's Health Story- ""I'm an actor/director, singer/songwriter and producer.
    When I was in college I began noticing a little swelling around my
    ankles and when I went to the doctor and after several tests, he
    gave me salt pills and told me to keep him apprised. But he had no
    answers and for years the swelling continued. No matter how many
    tests the doctors did, they still had no answers. A few years ago I
    was having dinner, when I felt the need to throw up. On route to the
    bathroom, I lost my balance, I fell and was unable to get up which
    surprised the heck out of me!! I felt like the lady in the
    commercial who says,""help! I've fallen and I can't get up""
    That episode led me to the ICU at VGH for a while and then I was put
    on dialysis which I now do 3 times a week for 4 1/2 sessions. I'm
    unable to do much film work and find it hard to get by on pension
    and disability funds and it has been a struggle just to pay rent. However, I remain positive that one day my kidneys will return to full
    function but until then, I continue to fight the good fight! I'm

    out that her current liver is in a late stage of chronic rejection.
    She is going to need another liver transplant in the near future and
    she is already in late stage liver cirrhosis. Over the past few years, Shelby has been suffering terribly from
    other health issues as well. Shelby developed Atypical Trigeminal
    Neuralgia which is a chronic pain condition that affects the
    trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from your face to your
    brain. Her Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia (ATN) has progressed to the
    point where she suffers from more frequent bouts of searing pain
    forcing her to significantly cut back on her jewelry designs. Shelby
    has been in and out of pain clinics and hospital for surgeries to
    try and help with the pain for over a year. Her most recent surgery
    for this was in early June 2018 and more will be needed to control
    the facial nerve pain that she refers to as “an ice cream head ache
    that just doesn’t ever go away”. Shelby is a fighter and no one would know by looking at her that
    she was suffering from severe chronic pain or in need of another
    transplant. Knowing the state of her liver, she just won 4 medals at
    the Canadian Transplant Games last month in swimming. She is a strong, motivated, and the most compassionate woman
    you’ll meet who needs our help to show her she is supported in this

    upcoming medical expenses, prescriptions, bills, hospital parking,
    gas money to VGH, after-transplant care, post-transplant
    accommodations, and more as she prepares for this next medical
    hurdle. Financial worry should not be something she has to stress
    over during this time. She needs to focus on her health and getting
    a new liver. I know Shelby will be more than grateful and so will I. Together

"6,668",Zach Branson's Medical Fundraiser,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,49,"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work

  proud dad to two wonderful daughters and a couple of Shar Pei's, and
  this September my wife and I are celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. After almost 25 years of doing social service work, I decided I
  needed a change, and left to return to school to study Information
  Technology at Fanshawe College.  I an currently in my final year of
  studies and hope to graduate this spring with my cohort. However, that's in jeopardy, along with a few other things, thanks to
  my medical problems. Medical Issues: Shortly before Chistmas 2017,
    while on a co-op placement for my program, I began to experience a
    recurring pain in my leg.  It would get better for a few days then
    come roaring back. The first time I sought medical
    help for it I stopped in emerg In St, Mary's on my way home from
    school.  The Dr examined me and concluded I had like torn a muscle
    in my leg, but because of my weight wanted to rule out deep vein
    thrombosis, and so scheduled me for a ultrasound. The results were, of course
    negative, so I treated it as a torn muscle, with RICE etc, and
    carried on.  Until it became unbearable and my wife had to drive me
    into the the emergency room in Stratford. This Dr thought it may be some
    kind of nerve pain in my thigh, but because of my weight wanted to
    rule out bursitis so he ordered an x-ray.  When I got to the x-ray
    department I was surprised to learn that they were x-raying my hip
    instead of the thigh bone, above the knee, where it actually hurt. 
    I explained my annoyance to the tech but she told me should could
    only do what the Dr ordered. Well that x-ray came back negative
    and I was sent on my way with a Rx for nerve pain and a plan to
    follow up with my family Dr ASAP since I was frustrated that both
    medical professionals had ignored my actual complaints about WHERE
    the pain was located and instead focused on my weight. Well, the semester was condensed
    due to the faculty strike,  and by this time it was late in the
    semester.  So I had to wait until after exams when I was in my next placement. My family Dr was great he listened
    about where it ACTUALLY hurt, checked range of motion etc before
    jumping to conclusions.  After all his checks he too figured it was
    something soft tissue related, and made a referral for me to a 
    sports therapy clinic.  However, he wanted an x-ray of the actual
    area of paint to go along with me so that they could rule out
    skeletal issues and then get on with a regime of physio. It didn't turn out that way. Instead, I got a call from my Dr's
    office saying they needed to see me and I had to get blood work done
    first.  When I went in my blood work was inconclusive, and he told
    me they'd found something on the x-ray and wanted to schedule more tests. So after an MRI, and more blood
    work it was concluded that it was likely metatstatic prostate
    cancer.  So more tests, this time a full body bone scan, a full
    thorax and head CT scan and a prostate biopsy.  And it was official
    I had advanced stage 4 prostate cancer with several metastatic
    sites, and I was devastated. The Challenge: As a full time student, a father,
    and husband of a wife who is only working part time, money is
    tight.  Well I'll be honest, beyond tight.  Cancer treatment is
    neither cheap or easy on the body and as a result I have not been
    able to work full time hours at my placement. Between out of pocket expenses, medical costs, and missing work due
  to appointments, medical tests, and treatment side effects we are in
  dire financial straights and have had one bill go to third party
  collections already. The average annual cost to fight cancer in Canada is over $60,000. 
  Well more than we are making, even including OSAP and health benefits
  from the college. What my family and I are looking for is help with the day to day
  bills we have incurred and will continue to incur as a result of my
  condition.  We would also like to pay off some of the debt we have
  accumulated already as a way of reducing our monthly financial load. Our target goal is $30,000.  That number is based on a combination of
  anticipated future non medical expenses, and paying down outstanding
  debt, which will allow me to focus on healing, completing school, and
  securing a full time job in my field. Please, I ask you, help me and my family while we fight against
  cancer together and I try to finish my education so I can provide for
  my family long term. Than you for your time, John O",https://fundrazr.com/john_olliffe

"1,747,934",American Gut,,,,,"The
    Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects worldwide
    have laid an important foundation for understanding the trillions of
    microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on health and
    disease. However, opportunities for the public to get involved in
    such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives you an
    opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s living on
    and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. The American Gut Project is a part of the Microsetta Initiative , with
    the goal of collecting microbiome samples and rich phenotypic data
    from populations across the globe. Some examples of what we have found using our data: Younger
  children tend to have more proteobacteria composing their microbiome.
   As you grow older, the diversity of your microbiome increases. (Based off our preliminary findings in 2014,
      found here ) There’s a significant difference between the types of bacteria
    found in industrialized populations vs. non-industrialized populations. McDonald et al. mSystems . May 2018. DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00031-18 Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the right-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” (if
    you would like to receive a certain number of kits that isn’t listed
    as a perk, email us at info@americangut.org ) . Your kit
    will arrive via USPS within 2 weeks after payment, unless you have added the “Priority Shipping”
    perk along with your kit. If You Live in Europe: Visit our sister site, British Gut , to join. If You Live in Australia or Singapore: While we do have sites set up in Australia and Singapore (known
    as Australian Gut and Asian Gut respectively), we ask that participants contribute an additional $25 on top
    of their contribution, which covers an international shipping fee . These sites allow participants to send their samples back to a
    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go out. I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be
      sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego.  This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so it’s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere
    Else: International participants are also
    welcome to join. The $25 international shipping fee also applies (which you must include in your contribution), along with other regulations . I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not
      be sent out until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of expedited shipping to our lab in the U.S. from
    some locations can be expensive , so it is also recommended that you look into the cost of
    return shipping (we recommend using FedEx as it is more reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level).  Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of
      California San Diego).  It will also take longer to receive
      results if you submit one of the following sample types: Oral, skin, animal, and environmental samples . A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome . Note that your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the American Gut Project help
      account ( info@americangut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that the Fundrazr transaction fee will be
        deducted from your refund. The consent forms are maintained on the participant website;
      details are included in your kit. To sign the consent form, you
      must agree to use an electronic format for your signature in
      accordance with the United States' eSIGN Act and California's UETA
      Act. You have the right to obtain the electronic record in a
      non-electronic form. The results you receive from submitting a sample are not
      meant to act as medical or health diagnoses . We will not be able to provide any clinical or medical
      information and recommendations from your results. If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at info@americangut.org.",https://fundrazr.com/americangut
685,Help Catherine get moving again!,U.S. Dollar,"Dec 31, 2018",of $2k goal,5,"Hi! My name is Catherine and I am a retired ballet dancer and
  teacher. As you might guess, I am very fond of moving! A couple of
  years ago, however, I was diagnosed with arthritis of the hip and this
  past year I have been using a cane to help me get around. I have a
  physical therapist who also helps me retain the flexibility, mobility
  and strength I still have. He told me that the most important thing is
  just to KEEP MOVING. Therein lies the problem, though, because the hip
  is a weight bearing joint and walking is painful. As my mobility has
  decreased, my weight has increased which puts even more strain on the
  hip. It's a vicious cycle. I know what you're thinking, ""Why not
  just get a hip replacement?"" Believe me, many friends have asked
  the same question but unfortunately, because of other health issues,
  surgery is not a viable option for me. Then I found a mobility device called the Alinker (see video), a three-wheeled walking bike designed to help people remain
    active, do what they love, and build strength so they can live life
    to the fullest. It's an alternative to the typical
    ""walker"" or a motorized scooter. My goal is to
  remain active as a volunteer in my church and my community. I work in
  a food pantry, volunteer often at my church as well as sing in my
  church choir, and I also participate in a community chorus that
  performs regularly at community events and nursing homes. The Alinker is not covered by insurance. As you know, insurance
  companies do not have a vested interest in keeping us healthy. But
  staying healthy is MY goal and I'm asking for your help by way of a
  donation to my campaign. Anything you can do will be helpful and I
  thank you in advance for your support.",https://fundrazr.com/01Q2F8
